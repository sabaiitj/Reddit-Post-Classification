Problem Statement - 3
The problem statement is provided for this project.

Data Collection - 2
Data collection method does not have any form of waiting mechanism. This is either bad for the endpoint server, or bad for your data collection when your requests are suspended or blocked as potential spam.

Data Cleaning and EDA - 3
Excellent work with both extensive regex and creation/use of helper functions. Clean, thorough EDA.

Preprocessing and Modeling - 2.75
Good breadth of both preprocessing techniques used and models tested. Some noting of model choice made because of processing limitations, but not much else.

Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding - 2.75
Analysis throughout indicates student understands baseline and metrics, and student interprets model for inferential purposes. Note: the "test" models trained on 500 rows appear not to use stratified data, which is why they broke and only predicted the majority class.

Conclusion and Recommendations - 2
Conclusion answers original question, though analysis appears to conflate post success with number of comments on post. Appropriate context is provided for each step. Impact to shareholders is implied but not explicitly stated. Future steps are noted.

Project Organization - 1.5
Images very much need to be moved to their own folder, they clutter the workspace. Notebook should be broken into multiple different notebooks by section.

Visualizations - 3
Visualizations in-notebook are relevant and appropriately communicate information. Visualizations in the readme appear to be broken and in need of replacement.

Python Syntax and Control Flow - 3
No issues here.
